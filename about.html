<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi! I'm Benigin Raj A, an aspiring Full-Stack Developer currently pursuing my Undergraduate degree in Data Science.
   I'm passionate about blending the power of data with the versatility of full-stack development to create impactful, user-centric applications.</p>

<p>From building intuitive front-end interfaces to developing robust back-end systems, 
I'm driven by a desire to understand how everything works together — both visually and logically.
 My background in data science gives me a unique edge in solving problems efficiently, optimizing performance, and making data-driven decisions in web development.</p>

<p>I'm constantly learning and exploring new technologies in both the front-end and back-end ecosystems, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and more. 
  I enjoy working on projects that challenge me to grow as a developer and push the boundaries of my skills.</p>

<p>Let’s build something awesome together!</p>
